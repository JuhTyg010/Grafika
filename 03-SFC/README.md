# Task 03-SFC
Your task is to implement many **Space Filling Curves** (2D pixel orderings)
and find one with the best locality preserving condition.

Locality preserving is evaluated by predictive image compression.
The best ordering gives us the least entropy when plugged into the simple
1-order predictive compression scheme (explained later).
