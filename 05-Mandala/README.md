# Task 05-Mandala
Your task is to implement **Mandala** drawing algorithms. You should create a command line
program that draws mandala without user interaction and saves it to a disk file.

Our **definition of Mandala**: image with a distinct circular symmetry. The order of
the symmetry is usually 5 to 8, giving angles 72 to 45 degrees.

You can choose to draw pixel by pixel or use drawing routines from the
[ImageSharp library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SixLabors.ImageSharp/).

# Your solution
Please place your solution in a separate [solutions](solutions/README.md)
directory in the repository. You'll find short instructions there.

# Credit points
It has not yet been determined.

## Use of AI assistant
Using an AI assistant in this role will be difficult. Sure, you can use
it for advice on how to plug in the libraries you need, or how to draw
a geometric shape using the `ImageSharp` library, but don't expect it to
give you meaningful advice on how to draw a mandala.

If you could get him to give some useful advice on that, I'd be very
interested.

# Example
You can find many relevant geometric drawings using this
[Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=mandala+image).
